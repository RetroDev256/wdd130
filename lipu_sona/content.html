            Toki Pona is a minimalist constructed language created by Canadian
            linguist Sonja Lang in 2001. Designed with simplicity at its core,
            it features a small offical vocabulary of ~137 words and only 14
            phonemes, making it very easy to learn. The language draws on
            universal patterns from various languages, aiming to help speakers
            focus on universal concepts while promoting positive thinking.
